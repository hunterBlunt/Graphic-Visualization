# Graphic-Visualization
Scene created for my graphic visualization class


How do I approach designing software?
When approaching software design I like to break down what needs to be done into small and manageable pieces. From there
I can build this pieces and then begin to connect them into a functioning program.

How do I approach developing programs?
Like was stated above I like to break these projects into small pieces then start slowely puting them together. The most important part of 
this proccess in my eyes is the testing that goes into putting these units together. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
All in all this was a very educational project for me. I have never created something like this and it was a real challenge. 
I think the knowledge of how graphic visualization works will help me in the future when working with front end engineers. So that we 
can meet eachothers needs and create something functional and beautiful.
